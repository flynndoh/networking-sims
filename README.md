# Neworking Simulations

Hi there, here are a few networking experiments I have implemented using the [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) discrete event simulation library and framework.

- [Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Simulation](/wlan/README.md)
- [Medium Access Control (MAC) with Carrier Sensing (CSMA) Simulation](/mac/README.md)

Please feel free to submit feedback or pull requests with improvements! :^)

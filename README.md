# Physical Layer Networking Simulations

Hi there, here are a few physical layer networking experiments I have implemented using C++ and the [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) discrete event simulation library and framework. This was done as an exercise to become more familiar with the lower levels of the networking stack, as well as to gain experience working with discrete event simulations.
